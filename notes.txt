CrudRepository does not need @Repository. Spring automatically creates a class that implements the interface that
extends CrudRepository and creates a bean.
@NotBlank does not allow "    ", but @NotEmpty does

Could not find or load main class: open terminal -> run ./mvnw clean

Child table manages FK. In this case, one student has many grades. Student is parent, grade is child.
Grade will have the student_id as a FK to reference the student associated to that grade.
From parent (student) perspective, it's 1:M, but from child (grade) perspective, it's M:1.
@MappedBy tells Spring JPA the other table holds the FK, so don't go making another join table or anything.
@MappedBy goes on the side that isn't the owner of the relationship (The one without the FK, AKA the parent).

If you get a transactional error, in repo class, add @Transactional to the JPA method you created.

SELECT * FROM STUDENT;
SELECT * FROM COURSE;
SELECT * FROM GRADE;

TODO:
Create API documentation (Section 20)
Handle exceptions for course and grade in Controller Advice class.
Add unit and integration tests with Mockito and JUnit (Section 16 & Section 21)
Create some custom validators (Section 10: 115, 116, 117)

For repos that find by id, return optionals and use or else throw.
Don't allow course code to be repeated when posting a new course.
Don't allow 2 grades with same student id and course id.

For deleting, call find by id(s) to return the object to delete (or else throw), then delete it.

Update students and courses.
Find a way to update grade not only for score, but course and student too (Maybe query params, if body not achievable).
    For body, maybe add student id and course id to grade entity as optional constructor args. If not present, set to
    values in path variable, else, set to values in request. In impl set values using setters.
Spring security (Basic for practice, then JWT instead)
