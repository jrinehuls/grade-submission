CrudRepository does not need @Repository. Spring automatically creates a class that implements the interface that
extends CrudRepository and creates a bean.
@NotBlank does not all "    ", but @NotEmpty does

Could not find or load main class: open terminal -> run ./mvnw clean

Child table manages FK. In this case, one student has many grades. Student is parent, grade is child.
Grade will have the student_id as a FK to reference the student associated to that grade.
From parent (student) perspective, it's 1:M, but from child (grade) perspective, it's M:1.
@MappedBy tells Spring JPA the other table holds the FK, so don't go making another join table or anything
@MappedBy goes on the side that isn't the owner of the relationship (The one without the FK).
