CrudRepository does not need @Repository. Spring automatically creates a class that implements the interface that
extends CrudRepository and creates a bean.
@NotBlank does not allow "    ", but @NotEmpty does
@NotNull means value cannot = null.

Seems like @NonNull from lombok takes precedence over jakarta validators.

Do @RequestBody and @RequestBody call getters and setters?

Could not find or load main class: open terminal -> run ./mvnw clean

Child table manages FK. In this case, one student has many grades. Student is parent, grade is child.
Grade will have the student_id as a FK to reference the student associated to that grade.
From parent (student) perspective, it's 1:M, but from child (grade) perspective, it's M:1.
The mappedBy parameter tells Spring JPA the other table holds the FK, so don't go making another join table or anything.
The mappedBy parameter goes in the @OneToMany on the side that isn't the owner of the relationship
    (The one without the FK, AKA the parent).

If you get a transactional error, in repo interface, add @Transactional to the JPA method you created.

In entity, to apply unique constraint on a column, in @Column, use unique = true.
In entity, to apply unique constraint to span multi-column uniqueness, in @Table add uniqueConstraints = {
    @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = {"student_id", "Course_id"})
}

TODO:
Create API documentation (Section 20)
Add unit and integration tests with Mockito and JUnit (Section 16 & Section 21)
Create some custom validators (Section 10: 115, 116, 117)

What if a birthdate is not formatted yyyy-MM-dd, yyyy/MM/dd, or is null, or not provided, or just ""?

Add update routes for students and courses.

Find a way to update grade not only for score, but course and student too (Maybe query params, if body not achievable).
    For body, maybe add student id and course id to grade entity as optional constructor args. If not present, set to
    values in path variable, else, set to values in request. In impl set values using setters.
